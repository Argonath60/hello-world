Wrote to Science Fridays Ira Flato about gravity, or more specifically, the lack of it. I postulated that gravity as a phenomenon of the macro effect of the imbalance between the sphere of influence of the electron and the sphere of infuence of the proton. neutrons not withstanding, because they each contain the same amount of charge (Balanced). An electron covers a much larger volume due to it's momentum wrt the proton it is, shall we say, balancing, the charge against it. F=(1/4pie0)*(q1*q2)/r^2 
Examine a universe with only two hydrogen atoms in it. If the Atoms start out 1 light year apart, how long before they coalesce?
Was the force that brought them together gravity? Or was it electrostatic attraction between the individual elements of the model?
Now imagine a universe of infinite size, with a mass per unit volume of charge over a sufficiently large enough volume that the mass per unit volume is invariant and isotropic. Does the difference in the electron and proton sphere of infuence matter on the macro scale?
Can someone do the math and convince me I'm wrong? 
We need a computer model that accurately describes the forces between to hydrogen atoms in a computer generated universe that has nothing else in it. Does tyhe model coalesce? 
Answers on a postcard please?
